# Python Blockchain Implementation

This project was made as a lesson project for a Python tutorial. The lesson was by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/learn-python-by-building-a-blockchain-cryptocurrency/). The project was useful for learning about blockchain & crypto-currency technologies as well as intermediate/advanced Python. It is a fully functioning crypto-currency blockchain implementation. The project uses Flask to implement a web interface.

# Instructions
The program is run by running ```$ python3 node.py``` and then navigating to ```localhost:5000``` in a web browser.
